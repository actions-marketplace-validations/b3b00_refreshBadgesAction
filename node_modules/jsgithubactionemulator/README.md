 # Js GitHub actions emulator

 The goal of this package is to help develop JavaScript Github actions. It allows local debugging replicating the [@github/actions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/core) package API.

 ## how to use

 ### install

 ```
 npm install jsgithubactionemulator
 ```

 ### use

 In your action's index.js (or whatever the main script name is), simply replace 

 ```
 const core = require("@actions/core");
 ```

 with 

 ```
 const core = require("../JsGithubActionEmulator/core");
 ```

 then you can write your action as if you

 ### debug locally

 ***configure***

 the jsgithubactionemulator uses a `.env` file to get the action inputs.
 All inputs must be prefixed with `GHA_` as in ðŸ§® 
 ```
 GHA_input1=1
 GHA_input2=some value
 GHA_input3=true
 ```

 There is one special value `GHA_EMULATE` (dfeault is false) that states if emulation must be activated. this way you can publish your actions with a reference to jsgithubactionemulator. In a github workflow environment the `.env` file wont be there and jsgithubactionemulator will redirect calls to `@actions/core` package


***run locally***

simply run !
```
node index.js
``` 

### full example

I've used this emulator to develop the [badges-cache-purge](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/badges-cache-purge) git hub action.
You can look at the [index.json](https://github.com/b3b00/refreshBadgesAction/blob/main/index.js#L1) for an integration of this emulator.
